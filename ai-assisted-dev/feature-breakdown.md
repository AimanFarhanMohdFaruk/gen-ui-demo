- **Basic matching accuracy**: Start with simple keyword matching
- **User adoption**: Focus on essential workflows

### Medium Risk (Nice-to-Have)

- **AI integration complexity**: Defer to later phases
- **Communication API limits**: Research before implementation
- **PWA offline capabilities**: Complex, defer to later

### Low Risk (Core Features)

## Recommendation

**Start with Core Features Only** for your MVP. This approach will:

1. **Get you to market faster** (2 months vs 6-8 months)
2. **Reduce complexity** and technical risk
3. **Allow early user feedback** on essential features
4. **Provide solid foundation** for future enhancements
5. **Focus resources** on what matters most

**Use your AI-assisted workflow:**

1. **UX Pilot**: Design the core screens (contacts, jobs, dashboard)
2. **Lovable**: Build the basic UI components
3. **Cursor**: Implement the MVP with Supabase
4. **Future phases**: Add nice-to-have features incrementally

This breakdown ensures you build a solid, usable MVP first, then enhance it with advanced features based on user feedback and business needs.
