Great question! You want to design a shared stages system that can handle both recruitment and sales pipelines without redundant database tables. Let me explore some design patterns for this.

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive analysis of different database design options for your shared stages system. Here's a summary of what I've explored:

## Four Design Options Analyzed:

### 1. **Generic Stages Table** (Simplest)

- Single table with `pipeline_type` discrimination
- Good for basic needs, but limited customization

### 2. **Polymorphic Stages with JSON Configuration** (Recommended)

- Flexible JSONB configuration for pipeline-specific features
- Best balance of simplicity and flexibility
- Easy to extend without schema changes

### 3. **Template-Based Stages with Inheritance**

- Reusable templates with per-user customization
- Good for organizations with multiple users
- More complex but very flexible

### 4. **Event-Driven Stage System** (Most Advanced)

- Separate tables for stages, transitions, and actions
- Highly extensible and automation-ready
- Most complex to implement

## Key Benefits of the Recommended Approach (Option 2):

1. **Pipeline-Specific Features**: Each stage can have different properties for recruitment vs sales
2. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new pipeline types (marketing, support, etc.)
3. **Performance**: PostgreSQL JSONB is well-optimized
4. **Flexibility**: Add new properties without database migrations
5. **Simple Queries**: Still easy to query and filter

## Example Use Cases:

**Recruitment Stages** can have:

- `candidate_visible`: true/false
- `requires_interview_scheduling`: true/false
- `auto_archive_after_days`: 90

**Sales Stages** can have:

- `probability`: 10-100%
- `requires_budget_confirmation`: true/false
- `auto_create_project`: true/false

## Next Steps:

Would you like me to:

1. **Create a detailed implementation plan** for Option 2?
2. **Design the API endpoints** for stage management?
3. **Create state diagrams** showing stage transitions?
4. **Design the frontend components** for the stage management UI?
5. **Explore the migration strategy** from your current system?

Which aspect would be most helpful for your development process?
